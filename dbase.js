Aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit the lowest values and paraffins the highest, with cycloparaffins and olefins exhibiting intermediate values. In a homologous series, the aniline points increase with increasing molecular mass.<br><br>Note 3 Although the aniline point can be used in combination with other physical properties in correlative methods for hydrocarbon analysis, the most frequent usage is to provide an estimate of the aromatic content (or &quot;aromaticity&quot;) of hydrocarbon mixtures.","This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of the ash content of petroleum products, such as distillate and residual fuel oils, crude petroleum, lubricating oils, waxes and other petroleum products, in which any ash-forming constituents present are normally considered to be undesirable impurities or contaminants. Ash can result from oil-soluble or water-soluble metallic compounds or from extraneous solids such as dirt and rust.<br><br>The method is applicable to products having ash contents in the range 0,001 % (m/m) to 0,180 % (m/m), but does not apply to products which contain ash-forming additives, including certain phosphorus compounds.

The method is generally applicable to relatively non-volatile petroleum products which partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pressure.<br>NOTES<br>1 The term &quot;carbon residue&quot; is used throughout this International Standard to designate the carbonaceous residue formed during evaporation and pyrolysis of a petroleum product. The residue is not entirely composed of carbon, but is a coke which can be further changed by pyrolysis. The term &quot;carbon residue&quot; is retained in this method only in deference to its widespread use.<br><br>2 The carbon residue of distillate and residual fuel oils gives an approximate ranking of such fuels in terms of their propensity to form deposits in specific applications.<br><br>3 The presence of alkyl nitrates in distillate fuels, or ash-forming additives in either distillate or residual fuels, will give carbon residue results that are higher than the corresponding values of the fuel without additives. These values may not correlate with the propensity of a fuel to form deposits.<br><br>4 The carbon residue of base lubricating oils may give an indication of the propensity of the oil to lay down deposits in combustion chambers, and/or of the relative chemical constitution of oils of similar viscosity. Most finished lubricating oils contain ash-forming additives, and thus the carbon residue of finished lubricants cannot be used in this manner<br><br>5 The carbon residue of a gas oil is a useful guide in the manufacture of gas.","This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of the pour point of petroleum products.

Solid or semi-solid products, such as petrolatum and wax, are tested in the molten state. This procedure is based on a trichromatic scale using a series of red, yellow and blue glasses to measure the depth of colour in Lovibond® units.<br><br>NOTE - This procedure was identified as procedure A in previous versions of this standard, which described two procedures for the determination of colour.","This method gives a measure of the ability of the oil to separate from an emulsion. It is commonly applied to turbine oils, but it may be used for other lubricating oils. The test is commonly applied to used turbine oils but since it is sensitive to aging and contamination of the oil, precision will be lower than that stated.<br><br>NOTE 1 Oils containing inhibitors may give much higher results than the corresponding uninhibited oils and the precision may be less satisfactory.<br><br>NOTE 2 For the purposes of this standard, the terms &ldquo;% (m/m)&rdquo; and &ldquo;% (V/V)&rdquo; are used to represent respectively the mass fraction and the volume fraction.","The Standard describes the 'Doctor' test for detecting the presence of mercaptans (thiols), hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur and traces of peroxides, see note 1, in automotive fuels, kerosines, and other middle distillate petroleum products.<br><br>NOTE 1 - The presence of a number of substances in the test sample can affect the result of the test.<br><br><b>Peroxides</b><br>This method cannot be used if there are more than trace amounts of peroxides in the test sample.<br><br><b>Carbon disulfide</b><br>If the test sample contains more than 0,4% (m/m) of sulfur as carbon disulfide it causes a darkening of the aqueous layer on standing and caution is necessary to avoid confusing this darkening with the immediate blackening due to hydrogen sulfide or that produced by mercaptans.<br><br><b>Phenolic substances</b><br>Certain phenolic substances (which may have been introduced as inhibitors) cause colouration of the aqueous layer and if their presence is suspected, a blank test with sodium hydroxide solution in place of the sodium plumbite solution should be carried out first for the purpose of comparison, see 6.1.","This International Standard describes two procedures, A and B, using the Pensky-Martens closed cup tester, for determining the flash point of combustible liquids, liquids with suspended solids, liquids that tend to form a surface film under the test conditions and other liquids. It is applicable for liquids with a flash point above 40 EC.<br><br>NOTE 1 Although technically kerosines with a flash point above 40 EC may be tested using this International Standard, it is standard practice to test kerosines according to ISO 13736[8]. Similarly, unused lubricating oils are normally tested according to ISO 2592[5]. Procedure A is used for the determination of the flash point of paints and varnishes that do not form a surface film, unused lubricating oils and other petroleum products not covered by Procedure B. Procedure B is used for the determination of the flash point of residual fuel oils, cutback bitumens, used lubricating oils, liquids that tend to form a surface film, liquids with suspensions of solids and highly viscous materials such as polymeric solutions and adhesives.<br><br>NOTE 2 For the comparison of the flash points of used and unused lubricating oils, such as in a lubricant monitoring scheme, used lubricating oils may be tested using Procedure A. However, the precision data for these materials is only valid for Procedure B. This International Standard is not applicable to water-borne paints or liquids contaminated by traces of highly volatile materials.<br><br>NOTE 3 Water-borne paints may be tested using ISO 3679[6]. Liquids contaminated by traces of highly volatile materials may be tested using ISO 1523[4] or ISO 3679.<br><br>NOTE 4 Precision data is only valid for the flash point ranges given in clause 13.","This document describes a method of test to determine the open flash point and the fire point of petroleum products.","This International Standard specifies a procedure for the determination of flash and fire points of petroleum products using the Cleveland open cup apparatus. It is applicable to petroleum products having an open cup flash point above 79 ??C, except fuel oils, which are most commonly tested by the closed cup procedure described in ISO 2719[1].<br><br>NOTE Flash point and fire point are indications of the ability of a substance to form a flammable mixture with air under controlled conditions, and then to support combustion. They are only two of a number of properties that may contribute towards the assessment of overall flammability and combustibility of a material.","This standard describes a method for the determination of free acid, free alkali and insoluble carbonates in calcium, sodium and lithium greases. It is not suitable for use when soaps of lead, zinc, aluminium or other weak bases are present, see note 1. Certain additives such as sodium nitrite interfere.<br><br>NOTE 1 - The soaps of weak bases react with potassium hydroxide and therefore the acidity of greases containing these materials cannot be directly determined.","1.1 This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of the stability of aviation and motor gasolines in their finished form only, under accelerated oxidation conditions, by measuring the induction period to breakpoint in a pressure bomb apparatus.<br><br>1.2 The method is not intended for the determination of the stability of gasoline components individually, particularly those with a high percentage of low-boiling unsaturated compounds, as they may cause explosive conditions within the apparatus. However, because of the unknown nature of certain samples, the specified bomb assembly includes a safety burst-disc in order to safeguard the operator.<br><br>1.3 The induction period may be used as an indication of the tendency of gasoline to form gum in storage. It should be recognized, however, that this correlation may vary markedly under different storage conditions and with different gasolines.","This International Standard establishes the rating of diesel fuel oil in terms of an arbitrary scale of cetane numbers using a standard single cylinder, four-stroke cycle, variable compression ratio, indirect injected diesel engine. The cetane number provides a measure of the ignition characteristics of diesel fuel oil in compression ignition engines. The cetane number is determined at constant speed in a pre-combustion chamber-type compression ignition test engine. However, the relationship of test engine performance to full scale, variable speed, variable load engines is not completely understood. This International Standard is applicable for the entire scale range from zero cetane number (CN) to 100 CN but typical testing is in the range of 30 CN to 65 CN.<br><br>This test may be used for unconventional fuels such as synthetics, vegetable oils, etc. However, the relationship to the performance of such materials in full scale engines is not completely understood.<br><br>Samples with fluid properties that interfere with the gravity flow of fuel to the fuel pump or delivery through the injector nozzle are not suitable for rating by this method.<br><br>NOTE 1 This International Standard specifies operating conditions in SI units but engine measurements are specified in inch-pound units because these are the units used in the manufacture of the equipment, and thus some references in this International Standard include these units in parenthesis.<br><br>NOTE 2 For the purposes of this International Standard, the expression &ldquo;% (V/V)&rdquo; is used to represent the volume fraction of a material.","This European Standard specifies a method for determining the degree of solubility of bituminous binders having little or no mineral matter other than recovered bituminous binders from asphalt mixes, in a specific solvent. Toluene is used as the solvent for reference tests.<br><br>NOTE Bituminous binders will have varying solubility in different solvents.","This European Standard specifies a method for determining the degree of solubility of bituminous binders having little or no mineral matter other than recovered bituminous binders from asphalt mixes, in a specific solvent. Toluene is used as the solvent for reference tests.<br><br>NOTE Bituminous binders will have varying solubility in different solvents.","This European Standard specifies a method for determining the consistency of bitumen and bituminous binders. Normal procedure is described for penetrations up to (330 × 0,1) mm, but for penetrations above this value, up to (500 × 0,1) mm, different operating parameters are necessary.","This method covers four procedures for measuring the consistency of lubricating greases by penetration of a standard cone. It includes procedures for the measurement of unworked, worked, prolonged worked, and block penetrations.<br><br>Penetrations up to 475 may be measured. Undisturbed penetrations are described in the annex B.<br><br>NOTE 1 - The National Lubricating Grease Institute has classified greases according to their consistency as measured by the worked penetration.<br><br>NOTE 2 - The procedure for the measurement of penetration of petrolatum is described in Method ASTM D937-IP 179, Test for penetration of petrolatum.2<br><br>Unworked penetrations do not generally represent the consistency of greases in use as effectively as do worked penetrations. The latter are usually preferred for inspecting lubricating greases. Penetrations of block greases can be obtained on those products which are sufficiently hard to hold their shape. These greases generally have penetrations below 85.","This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of sediment in crude petroleum and fuel oils by extraction with toluene. The precision applies to a range of sediment levels from 0,01 % (m/m) to 0,40 % (m/m), although higher levels may be determined.<br><br>NOTE 1 If this International Standard is applied to crude petroleum samples containing significant amounts of salts, an overestimation of the sediment content may be obtained because a proportion of the inorganic salts may be trapped in the extraction thimble. This problem is generally not significant for crude petroleum samples containing less than 0,l % (m/m) total salts.<br><br>NOTE 2 For the purposes of this International Standard, the terms &quot;% (m/m)&quot; and &quot;% (V/V)&quot; are used to represent the mass and volume fractions of materials, respectively.","This method describes a procedure for determination of the melting point of petroleum wax (cooling curve). It is unsuitable for waxes of the petrolatum group, the petroleum ceresin group, or to blends of such waxes with paraffin wax or scale.<br><br>NOTE 1: For additional methods used for testing petroleum waxes, see Method ASTM D127-IP 133, Drop Melting Point of Petroleum Wax, including Petrolatum, and Method D938-IP 76, Congealing Point of Petroleum Waxes, including Petrolatum. Results may differ depending on the method used. For pharmaceutical petrolatum, Method D938-IP 76 usually is used.<br><br>(Originally published 1977, reapproved 2001)","This International Standard describes a procedure for the determination of the smoke point of kerosine.<br><br>NOTE 1 The smoke point of kerosine is related to the hydrocarbon type composition, and provides an indication of relative smoke-producing properties in a diffusion flame.","This European Standard specifies a method for the determination of the softening point of bitumen and bituminous binders in the range of 28 °C to 150 °C. Technical warning - The change from mercury thermometers to electronic temperature devices has revealed that the temperature definition in the mercury thermometer has not been precise enough to make a correct, unbiased transfer to electronic devices. Care should be taken for softening points ring and ball above 100 °C as the condition may have changed from previous practise to present days testing equipment.

The test method may be applied to volatile crude petroleum with a vapour pressure exceeding 10 kPa, although the precision has not been evaluated.<br><br>Four procedures are described in this International Standard. Procedures A and B are alternative apparatus configurations for products with a Reid vapour pressure up to 180 kPa, Procedure C is applied to liquid products with a Reid vapour pressure above 180 kPa, and Procedure D applies to aviation gasolines with a Reid vapour pressure of approximately 50 kPa. Vapour pressure is an important physical property of volatile liquids, and has critical performance implications for automotive and aviation gasolines.<br><br>Vapour pressure is also one of the properties affecting atmospheric evaporation, and is therefore increasingly used in regulations relating to emissions and air quality control. Vapour pressure is also a critical property limiting the performance and safety of operation of equipment during transfer operations.<br><br>NOTE Because the external atmospheric pressure is counteracted by the atmospheric pressure initially in the vapour chamber, the Reid vapour pressure is approximately the &quot;absolute&quot; vapour pressure at 37,8 °C. The Reid vapour pressure differs from the true vapour pressure of the sample owing to slight vaporization of the sample and the pressure of water vapour and air in the confined space.","This International Standard specifies a procedure for the determination of the kinematic viscosity, v, of liquid petroleum products, both transparent and opaque, by measuring the time for a volume of liquid to flow under gravity through a calibrated glass capillary viscometer. The dynamic viscosity, n, can be obtained by multiplying the measured kinematic viscosity by the density, p, of the liquid.<br><br>NOTE 1 The result obtained from this lnternatronal Standard is dependent upon the behaviour of the sample and is intended for application to liquids for which primarily the shear stress and shear rates are proportional (Newtonian flow behaviour). If. however, the viscosity varies significantly with the rate of shear, different results may be obtained from viscometers of different capillary diameters. The procedure and precision values for residual fuel oils, which under some conditrons exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour, have been included.

It has been proved that high gum content can cause induction-system deposits and sticking of intake valves, and in most instances it can be assumed that low gum content will ensure absence of induction-system difficulties. The user should, however, realize that the test is not of itself correlative to induction-system deposits. The primary purpose of the test, as applied to motor gasoline, is the measurement of the oxidation products formed in the sample prior to or during the comparatively mild conditions of the test procedure. Since many motor gasolines are purposely blended with non-volatile oils or additives, the heptane extraction step is necessary to remove these from the evaporation residue so that the deleterious material, gum, may be determined. With respect to aviation turbine fuels, large quantities of gum are indicative of contamination of fuel by higher boiling oils or particulate matter and generally reflect poor handling practices in distribution downstream of the refinery.","This method covers the determination of the drop melting point of petroleum wax.

Two sets of procedures are included for computing volume correction factor: one set for data expressed in customary units (temperature in °F, pressure in psig); the other for the metric system of units (temperature in °C, pressure in kPa or bar). In contrast to the 1980 Petroleum Measurement Tables, the metric procedures require the procedure for customary units be used first to compute density at 60°F. This value is then further corrected to give the metric output. The metric procedures now incorporate the base temperature of 20°C in addition to 15°C.<br><br>1.4 The procedures recognize three distinct commodity groups: crude oils, refined products, and lubricating oils. A procedure is also provided for determining volume correction for special applications where the generalized commodity groups' parameters may not adequately represent the thermal expansion properties of the liquid and a precise thermal expansion coefficient has been determined by experiment.","This method describes a procedure for the determination of the viscosity of bitumen emulsions in arbitrary units at 20 °C using the Engler Viscometer.<br><br>The flow of bitumen road emulsions is non-Newtonian in that the relationship between shear stress and rate of shear is not linear, but under the conditions of the test the divergence from Newtonian behaviour does not normally lead to any difficulty in obtaining reproducible results.

It is applicable to both mineral and synthetic based products, but the current precision statement only applies to mineral oils.<br><br>NOTE 1 - Agitation of lubricating and hydraulic oils with air in equipment such as bearings, couplings, gears, pumps and lines, can produce a dispersion of finely divided air bubbles in the oil. If the residence time in the reservoir is too short to allow the air bubbles to rise to the surface, a mixture of air and oil will circulate through the system. This may result in an inability to maintain oil pressure (particularly with centrifugal pumps), incomplete oil films in bearings and gears, and poor hydraulic system performance or failure.<br><br>NOTE 2 - This standard measures the time for the entrained air content to fall to the relatively low value of 0,20 % (V/V) under a standardized set of test conditions, and hence permits the comparison of the ability of oils to separate entrained air under conditions where a separation time is available. Although the significance of the test results is not fully established, entrained air can cause sponginess and lack of sensitivity in the control of turbine and hydraulic systems.

This International Standard is applicable to liquids of any vapour pressure as long as suitable precautions are taken to ensure that they remain in single phase with no loss of light ends and subsequent changes in composition and density during both the sample handling and the density determination.<br><br>NOTE - If the determined density is to be converted to a density at some reference temperature using petroleum measurement tables, the determination should be carried out at a temperature as close as possible to the reference temperature in order to minimize uncertainties due to the use of generalized tables.<br><br>This method is not intended for use in calibrating on-line density meters.","This document specifies the methodology for the design of an Interlaboratory Study (ILS) and calculation of precision estimates of a test method specified by the study. In particular, it defines the relevant statistical terms (Clause 3), the procedures to be adopted in the planning of ILS to determine the precision of a test method (Clause 4), and the method of calculating the precision from the results of such a study (Clauses 5 and 6).<br><br>The procedures in this document have been designed specifically for petroleum and petroleum related products, which are normally considered as homogeneous. However, the procedures described in this document can also be applied to other types of homogeneous products. Careful investigations are necessary before applying this document to products for which the assumption of homogeneity can be questioned.","This document specifies the methodology for the application of precision estimates of a test method derived from ISO 4259-1. In particular, it defines the procedures for setting the property specification limits based upon test method precision where the property is determined using a specific test method, and in determining the specification conformance status when there are conflicting results between supplier and receiver. Other applications of this test method precision are briefly described in principle without the associated procedures.<br><br>The procedures in this document have been designed specifically for petroleum and petroleum-related products, which are normally homogeneous. However, the procedures described in this document can also be applied to other types of homogeneous products. Careful investigations are necessary before applying this document to products for which the assumption of homogeneity can be questioned.","This method covers the separation and determination of representative saturated and aromatic components in lubricating oil basestocks that boil above 270 °C. All compounds that are more polar than saturates, including those that contain sulphur, nitrogen or oxygen, are determined as aromatics. Brightstocks may give low recoveries. This method may be applied to gas oils boiling in the range 200 °C to 350 °C by substituting pentane for hexane at all places in the text. Care is required during the solvent removal stage to minimise the loss of volatile sample components and maximise the sample recovery which should be greater than 95 % (m/m). Saturates [%/(m/m)] and aromatics [%(m/m)] should both be determined by gravimetry and the results normalized to 100 %. Report saturates, aromatics and recovery to the nearest 1 % (m/m).","This method covers the analysis of refined and crude natural and synthetic oil-soluble sulphonate products.

It is applicable to materials with sulfur contents in the range of 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg. Products with sulfur contents above 100 mg/kg can be analysed after dilution with a suitable sulfur-free solvent. Products with sulfur contents below 1 mg/kg can also be analysed by a modified technique described in Annex A. The precision quoted only applies to measurements in the 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg range. Nitrogen interferes with the analysis at concentrations above 0,1 % (m/m), and chlorine interferes at concentrations above 1,0 % (m/m), but these interferences are overcome by the addition of sodium azide to the cell electrolyte. Bromine and organometallic compounds also interfere with the analysis at concentrations above approximately 500 mg/kg.<br><br>NOTE 1 The microcoulometric method is capable of analysing light liquid hydrocarbons boiling in the range from 26 °C to 274 °C (for example, naphtha and MS samples) that undergo pyrolysis at 900 °C to 1 200 °C.

The maximum total sediment covered by the precision evaluations of this method is 0,50 % (m/m)for residual fuels and 0,40 % (m/m) for distillate fuels containing residual components. Some fuels could exceed the maximum filtration time specified in this method due to factors other than the presence of significant quantities of insoluble organic or inorganic material.<br><br>For the determination of sediment insoluble in toluene, see ISO 37351).<br><br>NOTE 1 The method can also be used for the assessment of total sediment after regimes of fuel pre-treatment designed to accelerate the ageing process (see ISO 10307-2).<br><br>NOTE 2 Significant amounts of sediment in a residual fuel oil can cause fouling of facilities for handling and present problems in burner mechanisms.

Throughout the remaining text of this International Standard, the term &ldquo;cetane index&rdquo; implies cetane index by four variable equation.<br><br>This International Standard is not applicable to fuels containing additives for raising the cetane number, nor to pure hydrocarbons, nor to distillate fuels derived from coal. It is applicable to fuels containing non-petroleum derivatives from tar sand and oil shale.<br><br>NOTE 1 This International Standard was originally developed using a matrix of fuels, some of which contain nonpetroleum derivates from tar sands and oil shale. Other cetane index equations have since been developed which can be more applicable to tar sands products.<br><br>NOTE 2 The cetane index is not an alternative way to express the cetane number; it is a supplementary tool, to be used with due regard for its limitations.<br><br>NOTE 3 The cetane index is used to estimate the cetane number of diesel fuel when a test engine is not available to determine this property directly, or when insufficient sample is available for an engine rating.<br><br>In cases where the cetane number of a fuel has been previously established, the cetane index can be used to verify the cetane number of subsequent samples of that fuel, provided the fuel's source and mode of manufacture remain unchanged.<br><br>NOTE 4 The cetane index method is used to estimate the cetane number of the fuel, but does not take into account the effects of cetane improver additives that may be present.<br><br>The recommended range of fuel properties for application of this International Standard is as follows:<br><br>Fuel property Recommended range<br>Cetane number 32,5 – 56,5<br>Density at 15 °C, kg/m3 805,0 – 895,0<br>10 % (V/V) distillation recovery temperature, °C 171 – 259<br>50 % (V/V) distillation recovery temperature, °C 212 – 308<br>90 % (V/V) distillation recovery temperature, °C 251 – 363<br>Within the recommended range of cetane number (32,5 to 56,5), the expected error of the prediction via the cetane index equation will be less than ± 2 cetane numbers for 65 % of the distillate fuels examined.

It is not intended, for specific specifications and similar purposes, that estimated values of the net specific energy shall be used in place of experimentally determined values.<br><br>NOTE 2 - The estimation of the net specific energy of hydrocarbon fuel from its aniline point and density is justifiable only when the fuel belongs to a well-defined class for which a relationship between net specific energy and aniline point and density has been derived from accurate experimental measurements on representative samples of that class. Even in this class, the possibility that the estimates may be in error by large amounts for individual fuels should be recognized.","This standard describes two procedures for the determination of the viable microbial content of fuels and fuel components boiling below 390 °C. Procedure A is suitable for enumeration of viable microbial units up to 25 000 per litre. Procedure B is suitable for enumeration of viable microbial units above 25 000 per litre.<br><br>The procedures employ two selective microbiological growth media which nominally allow separate enumeration of bacteria and fungi. But as the media are not exclusively selective, it is possible that the determination of viable microbial units from the medium which favours bacterial growth will also include some fungi and vice versa. The microbiological procedures for distinguishing bacterial growth and for distinguishing between yeasts and moulds within the fungal content are not within the scope of this standard.<br><br>NOTE 1 If the approximate contamination level is unknown it is recommended both procedures are carried out.<br><br>NOTE 2 Some of the principles described in procedure B can also be used to determine the viable microbial content of water associated with the fuel.

However, the only likely interfering substances present in crude petroleum are mercaptans and ionic sulfides and providing that they are present at levels less than 0,05 % (m/m), the interference is insignificant when determining water in the range 0,050 % (m/m) to 5,00 % (m/m).<br><br>NOTE 2 An alternative procedure is provided in annex B for the direct determination of water over the range 0,05 % (V/V) to 5,00 % (V/V) in crude petroleum containing less than 0,05 % (V/V) of either mercaptan sulfur or ionic sulfide sulfur or both. The limitations under which this alternative volume measurement may be used are listed in annex B.

The amount of such insolubles is subject to the specific conditions, which are too variable for this test method to predict accurately.<br><br>NOTE 1 Oxidation is a chemical process causing adherent and filterable insolubles to form. Any substance such as copper or chromium that catalyses oxidation reactions will cause greater quantities of insolubles to form.","This standard describes methods for the determination of the temperature at which waxy solids form when middle distillate fuels are cooled. The wax appearance temperature (WAT) of a fuel is related to the lowest temperature of its utility for certain applications. Two procedures are presented in this method, designated method A (rapid procedure) and method B (slow procedure). The rapid procedure is convenient; the slow procedure yields results closer to the equilibrium value, with improved discrimination, and is expected to be applicable to fuels containing additives such as cloud point depressants, cold flow improvers and detergents. Both methods require only a very small sample (less than 50 ul). <br><br>NOTE 1 - For the relation to the wax appearance point (WAP) and cloud point (CP); see A.1 and A.2. Results from one laboratory on 25 base fuels indicate a direct correlation between WAT and either WAP (see A. I), or CP (see A.2) with correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. <br><br>Results in the literature (see A.3) where a similar DSC method was used on 95 middle distillates, indicate a correlation between the onset of crystallization by DSC and CP by IP 219 BS 2000: Part 219/ASTM D-2500 with correlation coefficients greater than 0.997. The slow procedure, method B, is based on work in the literature (see A.4) demonstrating improved precision with low cooling rates. <br><br>NOTE 2 - Limited work indicates that the slow procedure, method B, can be applied to crude oils with the modification of an increased sample size (at least 50 u1, or more, if the pan size allows), but precision has not been determined. <br><br>NOTE 3 - If a laboratory is set up for maximum sample throughput, one determination by method A takes about 10 min, and one determination by method B takes about 20 min. <br><br>For method A, precision has been determined within the range -26 °C to + 16 °C; for method B, precision has been determined within the range - 50 °C to + 15 °C. The precision samples were diesel, kerosine, light and heavy gas oil fuels","This part of ISO 10307 specifies two procedures — A (thermal) and B (chemical) — for the accelerated ageing of residual fuel oils. When combined with the hot filtration method specified in ISO 10307-1, these procedures permit the prediction of fuel oil stability, as affected by sedimentation, during storage and handling of the fuel oils.","This European Standard specifies a test method for the determination of the content of mono-aromatic, di-aromatic and tri+-aromatic hydrocarbons in diesel fuels that may contain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) up to 5 % (V/V) and petroleum distillates in the boiling range from 150 °C to 400 °C. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content is calculated from the sum of di-aromatic and tri+-aromatic hydrocarbons and the total content of aromatic compounds is calculated from the sum of the individual aromatic hydrocarbon types.<br><br>Compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen may interfere in the determination; mono-alkenes do not interfere, but conjugated di-alkenes and polyalkenes, if present, may do so. The precision statement of the test method has been established for diesel fuels with and without FAME blending components, with a mono-aromatic content in the range from 6 % (m/m) to 30 % (m/m), a di-aromatic content from 1 % (m/m) to 10 % (m/m), a tri+-aromatic content from 0 % (m/m) to 2 % (m/m), a polycyclic aromatic content from 1 % (m/m) to 12 % (m/m), and a total aromatic content from 7 % (m/m) to 42 % (m/m).","This method covers the determination of aromatic hydrogen and aromatic carbon contents of hydrocarbon oils. These include kerosines, gas oils, mineral lube oils, coal liquids and other distillates which are completely soluble in chloroform and/or carbon tetrachloride. The detection limit is typically 0.1% aromatic hydrogen and 0.5% carbon for Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers but for continuous wave (CW) instruments which can be used to measure aromatic hydrogen contents, the limit is considerably higher and typically 0.5%.<br><br>The method does not cover the determination of the concentrations of aromatic compounds in oils and is not applicable to samples containing more than typically 1% olefinic or phenolic compounds.","This method covers the determination of volatility of base oils and unused formulated lubricating oils for automotive use.<br><br>NOTE 1: This method was produced by Sub-panel ST-G-9.","This European Standard specifies a method for the determination of the total pressure, exerted in vacuo, by volatile, low viscosity petroleum products, components, and feedstocks containing air.

However, due to sample container size restrictions in taking automatic samples from vapour-locks either onboard a ship or from some land based storage tanks, the precision for 250 ml containers forms part of this standard and shall be used for referee purposes.<br><br>NOTE 1 This standard states precision for both 1 l and 250 ml sample containers. Annex A provides information on the precision values when using 50 ml at 37,8 °C or using 1 l samples at a test temperature of 50,0 °C.<br><br>The equipment is not wetted with water during the test, and the method described is therefore suitable for testing samples with or without oxygenates; no account is taken of dissolved water in the sample.<br><br>This method described is suitable for testing airsaturated samples that exert an air-saturated vapour pressure of between 9,0 kPa and 150,0 kPa at 37,8 °C.<br><br>This document is applicable to fuels containing oxygenated compounds up to the limits stated in the relevant EC Directive 85/536/EEC [4].","This International Standard describes a procedure for the assessment of whether liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) hydrocarbons consisting predominantly of propane and/or propene are sufficiently dry to avoid malfunctions in pressure-reducing systems installed in domestic, industrial and automative LPG applications. The test is normally used as a functional pass/fail test in which the behaviour of the product is assessed in a specially designed and calibrated regulator valve.<br><br>NOTES<br>1 If excessive dissolved water is contained in the LPG under test, it will cause freezing and blockage of a test regulator valve, which is an indication that the product could cause malfunctions in commercial pressure-reducing systems.<br>2 If the product under test contains an antifreeze agent, the time taken for the test valve to freeze is not necessarily a function of dryness, but may provide an indication of the tendency of the product to cause freezing in pressure-reducing regulators under service conditions.","This standard describes a method for the determination of the dropping point of lubricating grease by means of automatic dropping point apparatus.<br><br>NOTE - The method is useful in assisting to identify the grease type and for establishing and maintaining standards for quality control. The results should be considered to have limited significance with respect to service performance as dropping point is a static test.","This International Standard specifies a method for the determination of the amount of carbon residue, in the range 0,10 % (m/m) to 30,0 % (m/m), left after evaporation and pyrolysis of petroleum products under specified conditions.<br><br>NOTE 1 The carbon residue value serves as an approximation of the tendency of petroleum products to form carbonaceous deposits under similar degradation conditions, and may be useful in the assessment of relative carbon-forming tendencies of products within the same class. In this case, care should be taken in the interpretation of results. For products which yield a residue in excess of 0,10 % (m/m), the test results are equivalent to those obtained by the Conradson carbon residue test (see ISO 6615[1]) in the range of 0,10 (m/m) to 25,0 (m/m) (for details see Annex A).<br><br>This International Standard is also applicable to petroleum products which consist essentially of distillate material, and which may yield a carbon residue below 0,10 % (m/m). On such materials, a 10 % (V/V ) distillation residue is prepared by the procedure described in 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 before analysis. Both ash-forming constituents, as defined by ISO 6245[2] and non-volatile additives present in the sample add to the carbon residue value and are included in the total value reported.<br><br>NOTE 2 The presence of organic nitrates incorporated in certain distillate fuels will yield abnormally high values for the carbon residue. The presence of alkyl nitrate in the fuel may be detected by ISO 13759.[3]","This method describes a spectrophotometric procedure for the determination of hydrogen sulfide in fuel oil over the concentration range 0,50 mg/kg to 32,0 mg/kg. The precision of this method is critically dependent on the procedures and materials specified to minimise losses of hydrogen sulfide by oxidation and absorption.","This standard specifies a conductimetric titration method for the determination of the base number (BN) of petroleum products. It is suitable for both new and used products having base numbers from 1 mg to 40 mg KOH/g.<br><br>NOTE 1 - The method detects the relative changes that occur in the BN of an oil during use in an engine but any condemning limits have to be empirically established. Although the analysis is made under closely specified conditions, the method is not intended to, and does not report basic properties which can be used to predict the performance of an oil.<br><br>NOTE 2 - This method may be used for petroleum products having base numbers greater than 20 mg KOH/g, lubricant additives and additive packages but it will be necessary to dilute the sample in order to obtain a suitable sample weight. This will give an approximate base number because whilst this method is capable of measuring the basic constituents of these products the precision has been validated only in the range 1 to 20 mg KOH/g.<br><br>NOTE 3 - The base number expressed in mg KOH/g is a guide in the quality control of lubricating oil formulations and this method may be used for other petroleum products including lubricant additives and additive packages. The method may also be used as a measure of lubricant degradation in service as part of a used oil analysis programme.<br><br>NOTE 4 - Fully automated conductimetric titration systems may be used provided they have been proven, by use of an internal standard of known base number, to give a result equivalent to that obtained by the referee manual titration method. Some may require a fixed volume of sample to be used, which may necessitate dilution of the sample prior to injection if a high base number is expected. They should record the complete course of a titration by continuously printing out the conductivity or change in conductance versus the volume of titrant added.","This International Standard specifies a method for the detection of hydrogen sulfide in liquefied petroleum gases.<br><br>The lower limit of detectability is 4 mg of hydrogen sulfide in 1 m3 of liquefied petroleum gas. Methyl mercaptan, if present, produces a transitory yellow stain on lead acetate paper which, however, fades completely in less than 5 min. Other sulfur compounds present in liquefied petroleum gas do not interfere with the test.<br><br>NOTE 1 Liquefied petroleum gases and the products of their combustion should not be unduly corrosive or reactive to materials with which they come into contact. It is therefore important that the presence of any hydrogen sulfide, a highly reactive substance, be detected. Additionally, the odour of hydrogen sulfide is unacceptable in some applications of liquefied petroleum gases (e.g. lighter fuel).","This International Standard specifies a gas chromatographic method for the quantitative determination of hydrocarbons in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), excluding components whose concentrations are below 0,1 % (m/m). It is applicable to the analysis of propane, butane and their commercial mixtures, which may include saturated and unsaturated C2, C3, C4 and C5 hydrocarbons.

The range can be extended to higher concentrations by dilution of the sample. Additives can also be determined after dilution.<br><br>NOTE 1 The additive elements found in lubricating oils will affect the measured intensities from the elements of interest to a varying degree. In general for lubricating oils, the X-radiation emitted by the element of interest is absorbed by the other elements in the sample matrix. Also, the X-radiation emitted from one element can further excite another element. These effects are significant at concentrations varying from 0,03% (m/m) due to the heavier elements, to 1 % (m/m) for the lighter elements.<br><br>NOTE 2 The measured intensity for a given element can be mathematically corrected for the absorption of the emitted radiation by the other elements present in the sample.

The relative volatility is determined relative to a reference material (squalane). Only a very small sample mass (10 mg) is required for carrying out the methods.<br><br>NOTE 1 The relative volatility determined using this standard can be correlated with the evaporation loss as determined by the Noack method (see annex A and B.1).<br><br>NOTE 2 The rate of vaporization of a pure liquid is the mass loss per unit area per unit time. For mixtures there is an additional factor: the composition can change significantly if one component vaporizes faster than another. This effect is reduced by increasing the volume-to-area ratio of the sample.<br><br>NOTE 3 In general, the measurements depend on the experimental configuration, and data can only be compared with those from an identical experiment. For example, two correctly calibrated thermogravimetric analysers can give very different results due to differences in the shape of the pan, the pan suspension arrangement, the furnace diameter and the gas flow rate. However, this dependency on experimental configuration can be eliminated by measuring relative to a reference material and setting the operating temperature so that the vaporization rate for the reference material is the same for different instruments.<br><br>NOTE 4 Method A has a longer run time and is more precise than the shorter method B which can be useful for quick screening tests where the precision of results is not as critical.<br><br>NOTE 5 The precision for method A has been determined in the range 0,6 to 2,2 volatility relative to squalane, using mineral base oils and mineral-based formulations with Noack values ranging from 7 % to 26 % provided by the CEC PL-34 Panel.

Where viscosity affects the result before crystals are formed, the reported value of the no-flow temperature of the sample will always be warmer than the actual freezing point, and therefore is fail-safe and an indicator of possible flow anomalies at low temperature.<br><br>NOTE 2 The results obtained using this standard have been found to be equivalent to those obtained using IP 16, except for liquids having a viscosity of more than 5mm2/s at -20 °C. which can give a higher temperature (warmer) result than IP16.<br><br>NOTE 3 The presence of contaminants that affect the size and growth of crystals can change the freezing point as determined by automated and automatic methods.<br><br>NOTE 4 The lowest temperature at which aviation turbine fuels remain free of solid hydrocarbon crystals, which may restrict the flow of fuel through filters in an aircraft fuel system, is a key safety parameter in the specification and use of fuels.","This standard specifies a method for the gravimetric determination of particulate contaminant in aviation turbine fuel by laboratory filtration.<br><br>It should be recognised that, due to the difficulty associated with obtaining reliable results, a single one-off determination by this method is of limited value.

It is applicable to the determination of acids having dissociation constants in water larger than 10-9. Extremely weak acids having dissociation constants smaller than 10-9 do not interfere. Salts titrate if their hydrolysis contents are larger than 10-9.<br><br>NOTE 1 This method may be used to indicate relative changes in acid number that occur in an oil during use under oxidizing conditions. Although the titration is made under definite equilibrium conditions, the method does not measure an absolute acidic property that can be used to predict performance of an oil under service conditions. No general relationship between bearing corrosion and acid number is known.<br><br>NOTE 2 Since this test method requires substantially less sample than IS0 6618 or IS0 6619, it provides an advantageous means of monitoring an oxidation test by changes in acid number by:<br>a) minimizing test sample depletion for acid number analyses and thus minimizing the disturbance of the test, and<br>b) allowing additional acid number analyses to be made while maintaining the same test sample depletion, and thus providing additional data.<br><br>NOTE 3 Some oils, such as many cutting oils, rustproofing oils, and similar compounded oils, or excessively dark-coloured oils, may be more difficult to analyse by this method due to obscurity of the colour-indicator end-point.<br><br>These oils can be analyzed by ISO 6619 provided sufficient sample is available. However, this situation is much less likely using this International Standard than using ISO 6618, since the sample is more dilute during the titration and the end-point colour change is more stable.

European Directive 98/70/EC [1] requires that every separate nationally defined fuel grade should comply with one specification as defined in the Directive. Therefore, for each nationally defined fuel grade, there will be a corresponding European parent fuel grade. For instance, unleaded petrol grades placed on the market in Europe can be 91, 95, 98 RON petrol. See also the example discussed in 5.4.2. Some basic background ideas behind the FQMS are given in Annex A. Since the specifications for automotive fuels contain climatic related requirements, the FQMS is run twice a year, once during the winter period and once during the summer period. Information about the dates for the summer and winter periods in a specific country are defined in the country’s national annex to EN 228 and EN 590.

The implementation of specification limits for microbiological contamination in fuels is generally not appropriate and microbial contamination levels cannot be used alone or directly to make inferences about fuel quality or fitness for use. Further guidance can be found in the normative reference and other industry guidance documents. <br><br>NOTE 2 The test method may also be used to analyse other hydrocarbon, aqueous and non aqueous liquids and products but these applications fall outside the scope of this method. <br><br>NOTE 3 The test method detects numbers of microbial colony forming units (cfu), using the same detection parameter used in the laboratory standard procedure IP 385. However, whereas IP 385 provides separate assessment of numbers of viable aerobic bacteria cfu and numbers of viable fungal cfu, this procedure provides a combined total count of viable aerobic bacteria and fungal cfu. <br><br>NOTE 4 A laboratory study has been conducted to obtain data for the estimation of precision of this test method and further information is provided in the research report RR IP 612-2013 available from the Energy Institute.","This European Standard specifies a method for the determination of the dissolved residual matter, also known as evaporation residue, in liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), by gas chromatography in the range of (10 to 600) mg/kg (ppm mass).

This method only identifies and quantifies the following saturated monoglycerides: 1-C16:0, 2-C16:0 and 1-C18:0. The total saturated monoglyceride content is calculated by the summation of the contents of these three saturated monoglycerides. The precision has been established for FAMEs having saturated monoglycerides in the (200 to 1 500) mg/kg range.<br><br>This method is not suitable for FAME produced from or containing coconut and palm kernel oil derivatives because of overlapping of various peaks.<br><br>NOTE This Standard determines only three saturated monoglycerides, i.e. 1-C16:0, 2-C16:0 and 1-C18:0. FAMEs can contain also other saturated monoglycerides such as 1-C17:0, but these are generally much lower than the three targeted saturated monoglycerides and are therefore not included in the Standard’s scope.","This European Standard specifies a procedure for the determination of kinematic viscosity (?) at 40 °C in the range from 2 mm2/s to 6 mm2/s by calculation from dynamic viscosity (?) and density (?) of middle distillate fuels, fatty acid methyl ester fuels (FAME) and mixtures of these using the Stabinger-type viscosimeter.<br><br>The result obtained using the procedure described in this standard depends on the behaviour of the sample.

The thermometers shall conform to the following general requirements and to the detailed specifications listed. Purchasers should not accept thermometers as complying with these specifications because they are marked with IP markings, as these inscriptions are identification marks and do not necessarily constitute a guarantee. Thermometers with other identification marks may be used provided they conform to all the other requirements of the specification. Purchasers should satisfy themselves that the permissible scale errors, given in the table of special requirements, have not been exceeded. It is essential that thermometers be marked with a material resistant to the action of hot petroleum products. The format of the specification has been changed to conform with that agreed with ASTM in order to facilitate the harmonization of thermometers used in IP and ASTM methods. Thermometers numbered in the form ASTM x/IP y are those where the details have been agreed and are identical in the IP and ASTM handbooks. Such thermometers continue to be placed in the table according to their IP number. A list of these thermometers appears in Annex B together with thermometers that are comparable but still differ in certain details.
